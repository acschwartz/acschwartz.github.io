  description: This is a web development position, so I only put web development projects on this résumé. The posting asks for familiarity with specific programming paradigms and languages, so I highlighted the applicable technologies in the “skills” section. Beyond this, my résumé makes a good fit for this position because both of my internships happened to be in web development, which makes them particularly applicable.

  description: This posting does not favor any particular programming language or technology, so I didn't highlight anything in the skills section to demonstrate a breadth of experience.  It does ask for experience with at least one mobile or web language, which my work experience demonstrates. Since this posting doesn't favor any particular technology, I tried to show more variety in my projects, rather than using two web projects that used similar technologies. Although C++ is not one of the languages mentioned in the posting, it shows that I have experience with object-oriented languages, which is applicable to some of the technologies used in this position.
