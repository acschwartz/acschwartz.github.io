<p>Hi, I'm Annie Schwartz. I am a computer science student at the University of Minnesota, graduating in December 2020. My Clifton StrengthsFinder themes are Adaptability, Restorative, Woo, Communication, and Empathy. This means I'm a natural problem solver who is always looking to improve the current status quo, but also thrive around people. I'm also a proven leader, having grown my school's ACM-W chapter from a tiny group to a healthy, self-sustaining chapter that has the bandwidth to put on many events to benefit our school community.
